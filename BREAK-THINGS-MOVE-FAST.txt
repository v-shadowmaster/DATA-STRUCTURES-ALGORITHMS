From a senior engineer's perspective, "Break Things and Move Fast" is a nuanced philosophy that's often misunderstood. Let me break it down through the lens of learning a new technology:

The Productive Interpretation:

1. Don't get paralyzed by perfectionism

- Instead of spending weeks reading documentation and tutorials, start building something real
- Accept that your first attempts will be messy and probably need to be rewritten
- Learn through active experimentation rather than passive consumption

2. Embrace Rapid Prototyping

- Build quick proof-of-concepts to validate assumptions
- Use these prototypes to uncover the non-obvious challenges early
- Each "broken" prototype teaches you something valuable about the technology's limits

3. Create Fast Feedback Loops

- Write tests as you learn to verify your understanding
- Deploy frequently to see how things work in a real environment
- When something breaks, you learn exactly where your mental model was wrong

The Common Pitfalls to Avoid:

1. Don't confuse it with carelessness

- "Breaking things" means controlled experiments, not production outages
- Always maintain a safe environment for experimentation
- Keep production systems stable and protected

2. Don't skip fundamentals

- Moving fast doesn't mean skipping security best practices
- Still need to understand core concepts and principles
- Create guardrails to prevent critical mistakes

Example Learning Approach:
Let's say you're learning Kubernetes:

```
Week 1: Set up a basic cluster locally, break it intentionally
Week 2: Deploy simple apps, observe failure modes
Week 3: Experiment with different configurations
Week 4: Start hardening and applying best practices
```

Each step involves:

- Making educated guesses
- Testing assumptions
- Learning from failures
- Iterating quickly
- Documenting learnings

The modern interpretation at Meta and other tech companies has evolved to "Move Fast with Stable Infrastructure" - acknowledging that as systems mature, the cost of breaking things becomes too high. But the core principle of rapid learning through controlled experimentation remains valuable, especially when learning new technologies.
