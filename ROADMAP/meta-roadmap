I'll create a structured roadmap for a dedicated fresher aiming for Meta, optimized for 8-10 hours daily preparation.

3-Month Intensive Preparation Plan:

Month 1: Foundation Building

```
Week 1-2: Data Structures Deep Dive
- Morning (4 hours): Study + Implementation
  - Day 1-3: Arrays, Strings, Basic Sorting
  - Day 4-5: Hash Tables, Two Pointers
  - Day 6-7: Sliding Window
  - Day 8-10: Trees (Binary, BST)
  - Day 11-14: Graphs basics

- Afternoon (4 hours): Problem Solving
  - 4-5 LeetCode problems per day
  - Focus on Easy â†’ Medium progression
  - Start with Neetcode.io roadmap

- Evening (2 hours): Review + System Design basics
  - Document patterns learned
  - Study basic system concepts
```

Month 2: Pattern Mastery

```
Week 1-2: Core Patterns
Morning:
- Dynamic Programming (start easy)
- Backtracking
- BFS/DFS mastery
- Heap/Priority Queue

Afternoon:
- 6-7 Medium LeetCode problems daily
- Focus on Meta tagged questions
- Time your solutions (45 min max per problem)

Evening:
- Mock interviews on Pramp (2-3 per week)
- Review failed problems
```

```
Week 3-4: Advanced Patterns
Morning:
- Advanced DP
- Graph algorithms (Dijkstra's, Union Find)
- Trie problems
- System design fundamentals

Afternoon:
- 4-5 Medium/Hard problems
- Focus on optimal solutions
- Practice writing clean code

Evening:
- Mock interviews
- Behavioral preparation
- System design practice
```

Month 3: Interview Preparation

```
Week 1-2:
- Mock interviews daily (interviewing.io)
- Focus on Meta's most frequent problems
- Practice explaining solutions clearly
- Time management drills (2-3 problems/hour)

Week 3:
- Hard problems practice
- System design deep dives
- Behavioral stories preparation
- Meta-specific preparation

Week 4:
- Final revision of core patterns
- Full interview simulations
- Rest and mental preparation
```

Daily Schedule Template:

```
6 AM - 10 AM: DSA Study + Implementation
10 AM - 11 AM: Break
11 AM - 3 PM: Problem Solving
3 PM - 4 PM: Break
4 PM - 6 PM: Mock Interviews/System Design
6 PM - 8 PM: Review + Documentation
```

Key Focus Areas for Meta:

1. Problem-Solving Patterns:

- Graphs (heavily tested at Meta)
- Dynamic Programming
- Tree manipulations
- String manipulations
- Array optimizations

2. Implementation Must-Haves:

- Clean, readable code
- Optimal solutions
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Time/space complexity analysis

3. Topics to Master:

```cpp
// Graph problems (Meta loves these)
class Solution {
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& graph, int node, vector<bool>& visited) {
        visited[node] = true;
        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                dfs(graph, neighbor, visited);
            }
        }
    }
};

// String manipulations
string processString(string s) {
    unordered_map<char, int> freq;
    // Implementation
    return result;
}

// Tree traversals
void bfsTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    // Implementation
}
```

Additional Tips:

1. Document everything you learn in a GitHub repo
2. Maintain an error log of mistakes made
3. Create cheat sheets for quick revision
4. Practice writing code on whiteboard/paper
5. Record your mock interviews for review

Resources Priority:

1. LeetCode (Premium if possible)
2. Neetcode.io
3. interviewing.io
4. Pramp
5. Meta Engineering blog
6. CLRS Book for theoretical foundation

Would you like me to break down any specific part of this roadmap in more detail or focus on particular areas that interest you?
