Let me break down a realistic roadmap to become that exceptional self-taught engineer. This is a multi-year journey, but I'll map it out in strategic phases:

PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (6-12 months)
1. Core Programming
- Start with CS50x from Harvard (free on edX)
- Master Python for fundamentals
- Build basic CRUD applications
- Practice consistently on LeetCode (start with easy problems)

2. Web Development Fundamentals
- Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript thoroughly
- Build 10+ small projects from scratch
- Practice responsive design
- Learn Git and GitHub workflow

PHASE 2: GETTING SERIOUS (Next 12 months)
1. Deep Dive into Modern Stack
- Master React ecosystem (React, Redux, Next.js)
- Learn Node.js backend development
- Study system design fundamentals
- Learn TypeScript properly

2. Start Your First Major Project
- Build something YOU would use
- Make it open source from day one
- Document everything well
- Solve a real problem, not just a portfolio project

PHASE 3: LEVELING UP (Next 12-18 months)
1. Advanced Topics
- Learn C++ and Rust for systems programming
- Study computer networking in-depth
- Master database design and optimization
- Learn distributed systems concepts

2. Start Contributing to Open Source
- Fix small bugs first
- Read codebases of popular projects
- Start contributing to React ecosystem
- Document your learning publicly (blog/YouTube)

PHASE 4: BUILDING REPUTATION (Ongoing)
1. Build Something at Scale
- Start a serious project that solves a real problem
- Focus on performance and scalability
- Make it open source
- Market it properly (Product Hunt, Hacker News)

2. Community Involvement
- Start answering on Stack Overflow
- Write technical blog posts
- Give talks at local meetups
- Create educational content

KEY PROJECTS TO BUILD (In Order):
1. Personal Blog Platform
- Full-stack with authentication
- Real-time features
- Performance optimized
- Proper testing

2. Real-time Collaborative Tool
- WebSocket implementation
- Complex state management
- Offline support
- Multiple user roles

3. Developer Tool/Library
- Something other developers can use
- Published to npm/other registries
- Comprehensive documentation
- Clear use cases

4. Large Scale Application
- Microservices architecture
- Handle high concurrent users
- Complex data relationships
- Advanced caching strategies

DAILY HABITS:
1. Code Every Day
- Minimum 2-4 hours on workdays
- 8+ hours on weekends
- Track progress publicly

2. Study Computer Science
- 1 hour daily on theoretical concepts
- Implement what you learn
- Take notes and share them

3. Network Building
- Active on Twitter/GitHub
- Share progress publicly
- Help others learn
- Build in public

IMPORTANT TIPS:
1. Make Everything Public
- Code on GitHub
- Progress on Twitter
- Learning on blog
- Help others learn

2. Focus on Real Problems
- Don't build tutorial projects
- Solve problems you understand
- Get real users early
- Iterate based on feedback

3. Build a Personal Brand
- Consistent online presence
- Share knowledge freely
- Document your journey
- Help others learn

4. Stay Current
- Follow tech newsletters
- Read engineering blogs
- Experiment with new tech
- Understand why changes happen

Remember:
- This path requires intense dedication
- Consistency matters more than intensity
- Build things people actually use
- Network and learn in public
- Help others along the way
