Logic Building Problems  (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-science-fundamentals/mathematics-for-computer-science/)

Logic building is about creating clear, step-by-step methods to solve problems using simple rules and principles. It’s the heart of coding, enabling programmers to think, reason, and arrive at smart solutions just like we do.

Here are some tips for improving your programming logic:

Understand the problem: Read and understand the problem statement.
Generate Examples: Create additional input and output cases for each problem.
Draw observations: Draw observations and patterns based on the examples you created.
Start with Basic: First, think of the basic way to solve the problem then optimize the solution.
