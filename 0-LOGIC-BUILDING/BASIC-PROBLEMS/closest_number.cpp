Find Closest to n and Divisible by m
Last Updated : 09 Jul, 2025
Given two integers n and m (m != 0). Find the number closest to n and divisible by m. If there is more than one such number, then output the one having maximum absolute value.

Examples:

Input: n = 13, m = 4
Output: 12
Explanation: 12 is the closest to 13, divisible by 4.

Input: n = -15, m = 6
Output: -18
Explanation: Both -12 and -18 are closest to -15, but -18 has the maximum absolute value.
