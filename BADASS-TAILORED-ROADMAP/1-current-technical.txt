Thank you for such a detailed and honest description! I see a clear pattern: you have excellent theoretical understanding and problem-solving ability, but face challenges with practical implementation. This is actually a great foundation to build upon. Let me create a specialized roadmap that addresses this specific situation.

PHASE 1: BREAKING THE IMPLEMENTATION BARRIER (3-4 months)

1. Hands-On Coding Boot Camp (Self-imposed)

- NO VIDEO TUTORIALS allowed initially
- Start with small, must-complete daily coding tasks
- Rule: Write at least 50 lines of new code every day

Daily Practice Structure:

```javascript
// Morning (1 hour)
- Pick ONE tiny feature (example: user input validation)
- Write it from scratch without any reference
- If stuck, use documentation only (no tutorials)

// Evening (1 hour)
- Debug and fix morning code
- Add one small improvement
- Commit to GitHub daily
```

2. Breaking Tutorial Dependency

- Create a "No Video Week" challenge
- Use only official documentation
- Join Discord communities for real-time help
- Start with VERY small features, but complete them 100%

3. Project Transformation Strategy
   Start with your existing todo app:

- Delete all code but keep feature list
- Rebuild one tiny feature daily
- No copying allowed - write every line
- Document your struggles in a dev journal

PHASE 2: STRENGTHENING IMPLEMENTATION SKILLS (3-4 months)

1. DSA Practice (Implementation Focused)

- Start with arrays only
- Write code for 3 easy problems daily
- Focus on COMPLETING problems, not optimal solutions
- Use paper first, then code

2. Project: Build Your Tool

- Create a developer productivity tool
- Something YOU need daily
- Start extremely small (even just one function)
- Add one feature weekly
- NO TUTORIALS ALLOWED

3. Daily Implementation Challenges

```javascript
Morning: Code Kata
- Pick one basic operation
- Implement it 3 different ways
- Test each implementation

Evening: Feature Building
- Select one small feature
- Write pseudocode
- Implement without references
- Debug until working
```

PHASE 3: SCALING UP (4-6 months)

1. Original Project Development

- Choose a problem you personally face
- Start with a tiny MVP (seriously tiny)
- Add one working feature weekly
- Document everything you build

2. Focus Areas Based on Your Profile:

- Backend Implementation Practice
  - Build Express APIs without tutorials
  - Create MongoDB queries from scratch
  - Implement authentication yourself

3. Daily Routine:

```javascript
// Morning
2 hours: Implementation practice
- No videos
- No tutorials
- Documentation only

// Evening
2 hours: Project work
- Build one small feature
- Must work before sleeping
```

CRITICAL RULES FOR SUCCESS:

1. No Tutorial Rule

- Ban video tutorials for 3 months
- Use only documentation
- If stuck for >30 minutes, ask in Discord

2. Tiny Steps Policy

- Break everything into microscopic tasks
- Example: Don't build "user authentication"
- Instead: "Create a single input field for username"

3. Daily Implementation Log

```javascript
Today's Goal: [Tiny Feature]
Approach: [Your Plan]
Struggles: [What Was Hard]
Solutions: [How You Overcame]
Time Spent: [Hours]
```

4. Weekly Review System

- Review your implementation logs
- Identify common struggle points
- Create focused practice around these areas

Would you like me to:

1. Break down the first week's tasks in extreme detail?
2. Create a specific plan for transforming one of your existing projects?
3. Design a custom daily routine based on your available hours?

Let me know what would be most helpful to start breaking the implementation barrier!
