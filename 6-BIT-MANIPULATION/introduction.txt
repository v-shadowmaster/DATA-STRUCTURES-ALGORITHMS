1) What is Bit Manipulation?

- Bit manipulation refers to the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or binary digits (0 and 1) that make up integers in computer memory. It involves using bitwise operators to perform operations directly on the binary representations of numbers.
- Computers store all data in binary, so bit manipulation allows us to work at the lowest level of data representation, often leading to highly efficient solutions.

2) Why Learn Bit Manipulation?

- **Efficiency**: Bitwise operations are extremely fast (O(1)), as they are directly supported by the CPU.
- **Memory Optimization**: You can pack multiple boolean values or small numbers into a single integer, saving space.
- **Elegant Solutions**: Many problems that seem complex can be solved elegantly with bit tricks.
- **Competitive Programming**: Many DSA and coding round problems require bit manipulation for optimal solutions.

3) When to Use Bit Manipulation?

- When you need to optimize for speed or memory.
- When the problem involves toggling, setting, or checking the state of flags.
- When you need to count, find, or manipulate subsets (e.g., subset generation, power set).
- When the problem involves parity, unique elements, or requires O(1) operations on bits.

4) Bitwise Operators in C++

- `&` (AND): Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.
- `|` (OR): Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1.
- `^` (XOR): Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1.
- `~` (NOT): Inverts all the bits.
- `<<` (Left Shift): Shifts bits to the left, adding zeros on the right.
- `>>` (Right Shift): Shifts bits to the right, discarding bits on the right.

5) Common Bit Manipulation Techniques

- **Check if a number is odd/even**: `n & 1`
- **Get ith bit**: `(n >> i) & 1`
- **Set ith bit**: `n | (1 << i)`
- **Clear ith bit**: `n & ~(1 << i)`
- **Toggle ith bit**: `n ^ (1 << i)`
- **Count set bits**: Use Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm
- **Check if power of two**: `n & (n-1) == 0`
- **Swap two numbers without temp**: `a ^= b; b ^= a; a ^= b;`
- **Isolate rightmost set bit**: `n & -n`

6) Motivation and Real-World Applications

- **Subsets/Combinations**: Generating all subsets of a set (power set) using bitmasks.
- **Unique Elements**: Finding the single number in an array where every other number appears twice (XOR property).
- **Optimization**: Storing multiple boolean flags in a single integer.
- **Cryptography, Graphics, Networking**: Bitwise operations are fundamental in these fields.

7) Problems Solved with Bit Manipulation

- Counting set bits, finding unique/non-repeating elements, subset generation, bitmask DP, toggling flags, fast multiplication/division by powers of two, etc.

8) Important Bit Manipulation Questions

**Easy:**
- Count the number of set bits in an integer
- Check if a number is a power of two
- Find the only non-repeating element in an array where every other element repeats twice
- Swap two numbers without using a temporary variable
- Turn off the rightmost set bit

**Medium:**
- Find the two non-repeating elements in an array where every other element repeats twice
- Find the element that appears once when every other element appears three times
- Generate all subsets of a set
- Find the missing number in an array of size n containing numbers from 1 to n
- Count total set bits in all numbers from 1 to n
- Subset sum using bitmask

**Hard:**
- Maximum AND/OR/XOR of a subarray
- Find the maximum subset XOR
- Bitmask Dynamic Programming (e.g., Travelling Salesman Problem)
- Minimum number of flips to make a binary string alternate
- Find the length of the longest sequence of 1s you can get by flipping at most k 0s

9) Tips and Tricks

- Practice writing out binary representations by hand.
- Memorize common bit tricks and patterns.
- Use bit manipulation for problems involving sets, flags, or combinatorics.
- Always check for integer overflow in languages with fixed-width integers.
