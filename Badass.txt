I'll craft what a truly exceptional self-taught programmer's resume might look like - someone who's so remarkable that traditional credentials become secondary:

PROFILE
"Self-taught software engineer who built and scaled products used by millions. Dropped out to focus on building real-world solutions that matter."

TECHNICAL SKILLS
- Systems: Designed distributed systems handling millions of users
- Languages: Mastery of C++, Rust, JavaScript (Built compilers in all)
- Low-level: Assembly, OS internals, Compiler design
- High-level: Full-stack development, Cloud architecture
- Algorithms: Contributed novel algorithms to major open-source projects

EDUCATION
- Self-taught through building production systems
- Created and open-sourced complete CS curriculum followed by 50k+ students
- Regular mentor at coding bootcamps

Key Differentiators:
1. Built products with REAL impact and users
2. Deep technical expertise demonstrated through actual achievements
3. Significant open source contributions
4. Created tools other developers actually use
5. Strong evidence of independent learning and execution

The focus is on SHOWING rather than TELLING:
- Every project has measurable impact
- All achievements are verifiable
- Strong focus on building things users actually need
- Deep technical expertise proven through real work
- Evidence of ability to execute independently

Remember:
- This kind of resume works because the achievements are so extraordinary they overshadow formal credentials
- Each project/achievement needs to be genuinely impressive and verifiable
- The key is demonstrating exceptional ability through real-world impact
- Communication skills and ability to explain complex technical decisions are crucial

This resume style only works if the achievements are genuine and extraordinary. The person needs to have actually built things people use and solved real problems at scale. But when they have, it can be more impressive than any traditional credentials.
